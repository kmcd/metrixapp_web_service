Housekeeping
   clean up routes (nice restful names)

   Tests for signup / login / creating events

Improvements to exisiting features
   When only a few (or one) days data exists, 
      pad out date range to one week 
      maybe have minute by minute data instead
      only use whole numbers, half look crappy
      
   Pick most frequent data line for date scroller, otherwise plot line looks crap
   Hint to turn on/off data lines
   % changes for metrix
   /reports should have totals for entire period
   track unique visitors with a cookie
   3 step image (script/deploy/dashboard)
   handle https requests for metrix.js
   Add to documentation: how to make a http call
