WIP
   When only a few (or one) days data exists,
      - pad out date range to one week 
      - only use whole numbers, half look crappy
   Pick most frequent data line for date scroller, otherwise plot line looks crap
   
Next
   named routes for all accounts, eg http://metrixapp.com/ac/1
   clean up routes (nice restful names)
   Add documentation to explain how to make an http API call
   Rails helpers / plugin / engine
   Hint to turn on/off data lines
