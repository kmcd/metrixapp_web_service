Improvements to exisiting features
   Add documentation to explain how to make an API call
   Add browser frame to how it works section on landing page

   When only a few (or one) days data exists, 
      pad out date range to one week 
      maybe have minute by minute data instead
      only use whole numbers, half look crappy
      
   Pick most frequent data line for date scroller, otherwise plot line looks crap
   Hint to turn on/off data lines
